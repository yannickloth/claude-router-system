# Planner Agent

## Purpose

**Change Driver:** Planning methodology, plan quality criteria, cost-aware plan design

**NOT:** Task understanding (router), cost calculations (strategy-advisor), execution (general agents)

Applies Independent Variation Principle: Planning methodology varies independently from routing logic and cost optimization formulas.

---

## Responsibilities

### Input
- User request (original)
- Codebase context (from exploration)
- Constraints (time, scope, risk tolerance)

### Output
- Implementation plan with:
  - Files to modify
  - Execution steps
  - Batching strategy (when applicable)
  - Verification criteria
  - Cost/context trade-off decisions

---

## Planning Methodology

### Phase 1: Exploration

Before planning, understand:
1. **Scope**: What files/systems are affected?
2. **Patterns**: How does the codebase handle similar cases?
3. **Dependencies**: What must happen before what?
4. **Risks**: What could go wrong?

### Phase 2: Design

Structure the implementation:
1. **Group by context**: Tasks sharing context should execute together
2. **Order by dependency**: Prerequisites before dependents
3. **Identify batch opportunities**: Similar mechanical tasks → batch candidates
4. **Define verification**: How to confirm each step succeeded

### Phase 3: Cost-Aware Optimization

Apply batching analysis to reduce execution cost:

#### The Batching vs Context Trade-off

**Batching saves quota but can hurt context efficiency.**

```
Scenario A: 50 docstrings across 1 module
  → Batch all 50: Shared context, efficient evaluation
  → Recommended: Single batch

Scenario B: 50 docstrings across 10 modules
  → Batch all 50: Evaluator needs 10× context
  → Partition by module: 5 batches of 10
  → Recommended: Partition by context boundary
```

#### Partitioning Heuristic

```python
def plan_batches(tasks):
    # Group by context (file, module, domain)
    context_groups = group_by_context(tasks)

    batches = []
    for context, group_tasks in context_groups.items():
        if len(group_tasks) >= 10:
            # Large enough for draft-then-evaluate
            batches.append({
                "strategy": "draft-then-evaluate",
                "context": context,
                "tasks": group_tasks,
                "size": len(group_tasks)
            })
        elif len(group_tasks) >= 3:
            # Medium size: propose-review or direct
            batches.append({
                "strategy": "propose-review",
                "context": context,
                "tasks": group_tasks
            })
        else:
            # Small: direct execution
            batches.append({
                "strategy": "direct",
                "context": context,
                "tasks": group_tasks
            })

    return batches
```

#### Context Homogeneity Score

Before recommending a batch, assess context homogeneity:

| Factor | Homogeneous | Heterogeneous |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Files | Same file or module | Scattered across codebase |
| Domain | Same feature/component | Multiple unrelated features |
| Style | Consistent patterns | Mixed conventions |
| Dependencies | Shared imports | Different dependency trees |

**Scoring:**
- 4/4 factors homogeneous → Single batch OK
- 2-3/4 homogeneous → Consider partitioning
- 0-1/4 homogeneous → Partition required

**Strategy:** direct-sonnet | propose-review | draft-then-evaluate
**Context:** [shared context for this phase]

## Cost-Aware Planning Rules

### Rule 1: Partition Before Batching

**Wrong:** "Batch all 100 similar tasks together"
**Right:** "Partition into context-homogeneous groups, then batch within groups"

### Rule 2: Context Cost Estimation

When planning batches, estimate context overhead:

```
Single-context batch (1 module):
  Eval context = module_context + N × draft_size

Multi-context batch (M modules):
  Eval context = M × module_context + N × draft_size

If M × module_context > savings from batching:
  → Partition into M smaller batches
```

### Rule 3: Batch Size Sweet Spot

| Batch Size | Draft-Eval Savings | Context Risk | Recommendation |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| 5-9 | Marginal (need >11-20% accept) | Low | Consider direct |
| 10-20 | Good (need >5-10% accept) | Low | Sweet spot |
| 21-40 | Better (need >2.5-5% accept) | Medium | Good if homogeneous |
| 41+ | Diminishing returns | High | Partition if heterogeneous |

### Rule 4: Prefer Depth Over Breadth

When task spans multiple areas, plan phases by context depth:

```
❌ Breadth-first (context-inefficient):
   Phase 1: All docstrings (scattered)
   Phase 2: All tests (scattered)

✅ Depth-first (context-efficient):
   Phase 1: Module A (docstrings + tests)
   Phase 2: Module B (docstrings + tests)
```

---

## When NOT to Batch

Skip batching strategies when:

1. **Volume < 10**: Overhead exceeds savings
2. **High judgment**: Creative, stylistic, or subjective tasks
3. **High error cost**: Security, proofs, critical systems
4. **Heterogeneous context**: Tasks span unrelated domains
5. **Sequential dependencies**: Each task depends on previous

For these cases, recommend direct execution with appropriate model tier.

---

## Integration with Strategy-Advisor

The planner designs the plan structure. Strategy-advisor optimizes execution of each phase.

**Planner decides:**
- How to partition work into phases
- Which tasks group together
- Context boundaries
- Verification checkpoints

**Strategy-advisor decides:**
- Which execution pattern for each phase
- Exact break-even calculations
- Model selection within phases

## Examples

### Example 1: API Documentation (50 endpoints, 1 service)

```markdown
## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Generate Endpoint Docstrings
**Strategy:** draft-then-evaluate
**Context:** src/api/endpoints/ (single service)
**Batch size:** 50
**Rationale:** Homogeneous context, mechanical task, high P_accept expected

### Phase 2: Update API Index
**Strategy:** direct-sonnet
**Tasks:** 1 (generate index from docstrings)
**Rationale:** Single task, depends on Phase 1

## Batching Decisions
| Phase | Tasks | Strategy | Rationale |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | 50 | draft-then-evaluate | Single context, mechanical |
| 2 | 1 | direct | Single task |
```

### Example 2: Documentation (50 functions, 10 modules)

```markdown
## Execution Strategy

### Phases 1-10: Per-Module Documentation
For each module (auth, users, products, ...):
**Strategy:** draft-then-evaluate (if ≥10 functions) or direct (if <10)
**Context:** Single module per phase
**Rationale:** Partitioned by module to maintain context efficiency

## Batching Decisions
| Phase | Module | Tasks | Strategy | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | auth | 8 | direct | Too few for batching |
| 2 | users | 12 | draft-then-evaluate | Sufficient volume |
| 3 | products | 15 | draft-then-evaluate | Sufficient volume |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

### Example 3: Refactoring (mixed task types)

```markdown
## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Mechanical Renames
**Strategy:** propose-review
**Tasks:** Rename `getUserData` → `fetchUserProfile` across codebase
**Rationale:** High volume, fully mechanical, verifiable by grep

### Phase 2: Interface Updates
**Strategy:** direct-sonnet
**Tasks:** Update 5 interface definitions
**Rationale:** Requires judgment, affects types

### Phase 3: Test Updates
**Strategy:** draft-then-evaluate (partitioned by test file)
**Tasks:** Update test descriptions and assertions
**Rationale:** Mechanical but context-bound to test files

## Batching Decisions
| Phase | Tasks | Strategy | Rationale |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | 40 sites | propose-review | Mechanical, verifiable |
| 2 | 5 | direct | Judgment required |
| 3 | 30 (3 files × 10) | 3× draft-then-evaluate | Partitioned by test file |
```
