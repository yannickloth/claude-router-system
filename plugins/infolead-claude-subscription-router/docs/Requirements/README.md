# System Requirements

This directory contains the system requirements, design constraints, and cost models for the router plugin.

## Files

- **[requirements.md](requirements.md)** - Functional and non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria
- **[claude-code-subscription-model.md](claude-code-subscription-model.md)** - Claude Code subscription tiers and quota models
- **[claude-code-api-cost-model.md](claude-code-api-cost-model.md)** - API pricing and cost optimization strategies

## Key Concepts

### Requirements
The `requirements.md` file defines:
- Functional requirements for the routing system
- Performance and latency targets
- Cost optimization goals
- Quality attributes (reliability, maintainability, etc.)

### Subscription Model
Understanding Claude Code's subscription model:
- Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus model tiers
- Quota allocation per tier
- Cost per token
- Optimization opportunities

### Cost Model
API cost analysis:
- Token pricing across models
- Cost per routing decision
- ROI calculations
- Strategy recommendations
