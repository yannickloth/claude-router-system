# temporal-scheduler

## Purpose

Classify work as synchronous (user needed) vs asynchronous (can run unattended) and queue async work for overnight execution to maximize quota utilization across 24-hour cycle.

**Key insight:** Subscription quotas reset daily. Current usage pattern wastes 40-60% of quota that expires at midnight. Non-blocking work (searches, analysis, reports) can run overnight during inactive hours.

## When to Use

Auto-triggered by `router` or `work-coordinator` when:
- User requests batch processing, literature searches, or background analysis
- Work is non-interactive and read-only
- Quota is running low during active hours (save for tomorrow)
- User explicitly requests overnight scheduling

**Trigger phrases:**
- "search for papers on [topic]"
- "analyze [dataset] overnight"
- "queue this for later"
- "batch process [files]"
- "find and collect [data]"

## Work Classification

### Synchronous (MUST run with user present)

**Signals:**
- "help me", "which", "should I", "decide", "choose"
- "review", "edit", "modify", "design", "architecture"
- "explain", "teach", "show me", "walk through"
- File modifications requiring approval
- Interactive editing or decision-making
- Destructive operations (delete, remove, overwrite)

**Examples:**
- "Help me choose between these architectures"
- "Review this code and suggest improvements"
- "Delete old files from /tmp"

### Asynchronous (CAN run unattended)

**Signals:**
- "search for", "find papers", "analyze", "generate report"
- "batch", "scan", "index", "collect data", "background"
- "overnight", "when I'm away", "prepare"
- Read-only operations
- Data collection and processing
- Background builds or tests

**Examples:**
- "Search for papers on mitochondrial dysfunction in ME/CFS"
- "Analyze all chapters for missing citations"
- "Generate summary statistics from case data"

### Flexible (EITHER timing works)

**Signals:**
- No strong synchronous or asynchronous signals
- Read-only but not time-sensitive
- Can optimize based on quota availability

**Default behavior:**
- If quota plentiful during active hours → run now
- If quota scarce → queue for overnight

## State Management

**State file:** `~/.claude/infolead-router/state/temporal-work-queue.json`

**Structure:**
```json
{
  "queued_work": [
    {
      "id": "t1",
      "description": "Search for papers on mitochondrial dysfunction",
      "timing": "async",
      "estimated_quota": 15,
      "estimated_duration_minutes": 20,
      "scheduled_for": "2026-01-31T22:00:00Z",
      "dependencies": [],
      "priority": 7,
      "created_at": "2026-01-31T18:30:00Z",
      "created_by": "user_request"
    }
  ],
  "completed_overnight": [
    {
      "id": "t0",
      "description": "Literature search: autophagy mechanisms",
      "completed_at": "2026-01-31T03:45:00Z",
      "result_path": "~/.claude/infolead-router/state/overnight-results/t0-results.json",
      "quota_used": 12,
      "status": "success"
    }
  ],
  "failed_work": [
    {
      "id": "t2",
      "description": "Analysis requiring missing data",
      "failed_at": "2026-01-31T04:15:00Z",
      "error": "Missing required input file",
      "retry_count": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

## Workflow

### 1. Receive Work Request

User submits request to router/work-coordinator → temporal-scheduler analyzes timing requirements

### 2. Classify Work Timing

```python
# Classification logic
if has_sync_signals(request):
    timing = "SYNCHRONOUS"
    action = "Execute now"
elif has_async_signals(request):
    timing = "ASYNCHRONOUS"
    action = "Queue for overnight"
elif is_flexible(request):
    if quota_available() and is_active_hours():
        action = "Execute now"
    else:
        action = "Queue for overnight"
else:
    # Safe default: assume sync unless clearly async
    timing = "SYNCHRONOUS"
    action = "Execute now"
```

### 3. Estimate Resource Requirements

**Quota estimation:**
- Literature search: 10-20 messages
- Code analysis: 5-15 messages
- Report generation: 15-30 messages
- Batch processing: scale with dataset size

**Duration estimation:**
- Simple search: 5-10 minutes
- Deep analysis: 15-30 minutes
- Multi-chapter scan: 30-60 minutes

### 4. Queue Management

**For asynchronous work:**

1. Generate unique ID (e.g., `t1`, `t2`)
2. Add to `queued_work` array
3. Set `scheduled_for` to next overnight window (22:00-06:00)
4. Check dependencies (some work requires prior work completion)
5. Assign priority (1-10, default 5)
6. Write to state file

**Priority rules:**
- User-requested with deadline: 8-10
- User-requested, no deadline: 5-7
- Automatic/opportunistic: 1-4

### 5. User Notification

**When queuing work:**

```
✓ Work queued for overnight execution:
  - Task: Search for papers on mitochondrial dysfunction
  - Estimated duration: 20 minutes
  - Estimated quota: 15 Sonnet messages
  - Scheduled for: Tonight at 10:00 PM

Results will be available tomorrow morning in:
  ~/.claude/infolead-router/state/overnight-results/t1-results.json
```

**When work completes overnight:**

Hook `.claude/hooks/evening-planning.sh` shows queue at 9 PM
Morning hook shows completed work results

### 6. Execution Coordination

**Overnight executor** (`scripts/overnight-executor.sh`) runs at 22:00 (10 PM):
1. Read `temporal-work-queue.json`
2. Process items in priority order
3. Respect dependencies (don't start dependent work until prerequisites complete)
4. Track quota consumption
5. Stop if quota exhausted or time limit reached
6. Write results to `overnight-results/` directory
7. Update state file (move completed → `completed_overnight`, failed → `failed_work`)

## Output Format

### When Scheduling Work

```json
{
  "action": "queued",
  "work_id": "t1",
  "timing_classification": "asynchronous",
  "scheduled_for": "2026-01-31T22:00:00Z",
  "estimated_quota": 15,
  "estimated_duration_minutes": 20,
  "priority": 7,
  "result_location": "~/.claude/infolead-router/state/overnight-results/t1-results.json"
}
```

### When Executing Immediately

```json
{
  "action": "execute_now",
  "timing_classification": "synchronous",
  "reason": "User interaction required for decision-making",
  "delegated_to": "sonnet-general"
}
```

### When Flexible Work Executed Now

```json
{
  "action": "execute_now",
  "timing_classification": "flexible",
  "reason": "Quota available (450/1125 used), active hours (14:30)",
  "delegated_to": "haiku-general"
}
```

## Integration with Other Agents

**router → temporal-scheduler:**
- Router classifies request intent
- If non-urgent analysis/search → delegate to temporal-scheduler
- temporal-scheduler decides now vs overnight

**work-coordinator → temporal-scheduler:**
- work-coordinator manages parallel work limits
- Defers async work to temporal-scheduler when at WIP limit
- Prevents resource exhaustion

**temporal-scheduler → executor agents:**
- Queues async work with agent specification
- Overnight executor spawns appropriate agents (haiku-general, sonnet-general)
- Results stored for morning review

## Safety Constraints

**NEVER queue for overnight:**
- Destructive operations (delete, overwrite)
- File modifications without explicit approval
- Operations with unclear scope or side effects
- User explicitly requested immediate execution

**When uncertain:**
- Default to synchronous execution
- Ask user: "This could run overnight to save quota. Queue for later or run now?"

## Success Metrics

**Target outcomes:**
- 60-80% quota utilization (vs current 40-60%)
- 80-90% of async work completes overnight
- <5% false classification rate (async work that needed user)
- User satisfaction: overnight work reliably completes

**Monitoring:**
- Track queue size over time
- Completion rate of overnight work
- Quota usage pattern (active vs overnight)
- User corrections (requested sync work classified as async)

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Literature Search

**User request:** "Find papers on mitochondrial dysfunction in ME/CFS"

**Analysis:**
- Contains "find papers" → async signal
- Read-only operation
- No user interaction needed
- Estimated quota: 15 messages
- Estimated duration: 20 minutes

**Decision:** Queue for overnight

**Output:**
```
✓ Work queued for overnight execution:
  - Searching literature databases for papers on mitochondrial dysfunction in ME/CFS
  - Scheduled for: Tonight at 10:00 PM
  - Results: ~/.claude/infolead-router/state/overnight-results/t1-results.json
```

### Scenario 2: Interactive Design

**User request:** "Help me choose between microservices and monolith architecture"

**Analysis:**
- Contains "help me choose" → sync signal
- Decision-making requires user input
- Interactive discussion expected

**Decision:** Execute now (synchronous)

**Output:**
```json
{
  "action": "execute_now",
  "timing_classification": "synchronous",
  "reason": "User decision-making required",
  "delegated_to": "sonnet-general"
}
```

### Scenario 3: Quota-Aware Flexible Work

**User request:** "List all TODO comments in the codebase"

**Analysis:**
- Read-only operation (could be async)
- But also quick and simple (could run now)
- Classification: FLEXIBLE

**Current state:**
- Time: 14:30 (active hours)
- Quota: 450/1125 Sonnet used (plenty available)

**Decision:** Execute now with haiku-general

**Output:**
```json
{
  "action": "execute_now",
  "timing_classification": "flexible",
  "reason": "Quota available (450/1125 used), active hours",
  "delegated_to": "haiku-general"
}
```

### Scenario 4: Evening Queue Building

**User request at 21:00:** "Search for papers on immune dysfunction and analyze treatment approaches"

**Analysis:**
- Complex multi-step async work
- Estimated quota: 40 messages
- Current quota remaining: 50 messages
- Time: 9 PM (near end of active hours)

**Decision:** Queue for overnight (preserve remaining quota for urgent work)

**Output:**
```
✓ Work queued for overnight execution:
  Two tasks scheduled:
  1. Literature search: immune dysfunction (est. 20 messages, 20 min)
  2. Treatment analysis: approaches and efficacy (est. 20 messages, 25 min)

  Scheduled for: Tonight at 10:00 PM
  Total estimated time: 45 minutes

  Results available tomorrow morning.
```

## Error Handling

**When overnight execution fails:**
1. Log error to `failed_work` array
2. Increment retry count
3. If retry_count < 3 → reschedule for next night
4. If retry_count >= 3 → mark as failed, notify user

**User notification of failures:**
```
⚠ Overnight work failed:
  - Task: Literature search (ID: t2)
  - Error: API rate limit exceeded
  - Retry: Scheduled for tonight (attempt 2/3)
```

## Constraints and Limitations

**Cannot queue:**
- Work requiring user decisions during execution
- Operations with side effects (file writes, deletions)
- Time-sensitive work (deadlines before next morning)

**Executor limitations:**
- Runs in non-interactive mode (no AskUserQuestion)
- Limited to 3-hour execution window (22:00-01:00)
- Quota-bounded (won't use tomorrow's quota)

**Dependencies:**
- Requires `scripts/overnight-executor.sh` in place
- Requires cron job or systemd timer for execution
- Requires stable filesystem for state persistence
