feat(router): v1.7.0 - Multi-Project Support with Hybrid Architecture

Add complete multi-project isolation while maintaining global router logic.
This release fixes all critical multi-project issues identified in pre-production analysis.

Key Features:
- Automatic project detection via .claude directory traversal
- Project-specific state/metrics/logs isolation (no more corruption)
- Project-aware configuration cascade (project → global → defaults)
- Per-project enable/disable support via settings.json
- File locking prevents race conditions in concurrent sessions
- Flexible systemd paths support any installation location
- One-command migration from v1.6.x via migration script

Architecture: Hybrid (Global router logic + Project-specific state)

Storage Structure:
- Before: ~/.claude/.../state/ (global, all projects mixed ❌)
- After: ~/.claude/.../projects/{id}/state/ (isolated per project ✅)

Files Changed:
- hooks/common-functions.sh: +130 lines (5 new project functions)
- hooks/*.sh: 6 hooks updated for project isolation
- implementation/adaptive_orchestrator.py: +65 lines (project config cascade)
- systemd/*.service: Template with __PLUGIN_ROOT__ placeholder
- scripts/migrate-to-project-isolation.sh: NEW (200+ lines)
- docs/MULTI-PROJECT-ARCHITECTURE.md: NEW (500+ lines)
- MULTI-PROJECT-FIXES-SUMMARY.md: NEW (executive summary)
- RELEASE-v1.7.0.md: NEW (release notes)
- CHANGELOG.md: v1.7.0 entry
- README.md: Multi-project section
- plugin.json: v1.6.2 → v1.7.0

Benefits:
✅ No state corruption when switching projects
✅ Work on 5+ projects simultaneously
✅ Accurate per-project cost tracking
✅ Project-specific routing configuration
✅ Safe concurrent sessions with file locking
✅ Clean migration path for existing users

Breaking Changes: None
- Migration preserves all existing data
- Graceful fallback to "global" if no .claude directory found

Documentation:
- See docs/MULTI-PROJECT-ARCHITECTURE.md for complete guide
- See MULTI-PROJECT-FIXES-SUMMARY.md for technical details
- See RELEASE-v1.7.0.md for release announcement

Testing:
- Run scripts/validate-installation.sh to verify installation
- Test scenarios in MULTI-PROJECT-ARCHITECTURE.md
